\section{Introduction}

Telecommunication  infrastructures consist of a myriad of technologies from specialized domains such as radio,  access, transport, core and (virtualized) data center networks. Designing, deploying and operating end-to-end services are commonly   manual and long processes performed via traditional \gls{oss} resulting in long lead times (weeks or months) until effective service delivery~\cite{BluePlanet2017ProductsOrchestration}. Moreover, the involved workflows are commonly hampered by built-in hazards of infrastructures strongly coupled to physical topologies and hardware-specific constraints.

Technological advances under the flags of \gls{sdn} \cite{surveySDN} and \gls{nfv} \cite{Mijumbi2016NetworkChallenges} bring new ways in which network operators can create, deploy, and manage their services. \gls{sdn} and \gls{nfv}, as well as cloud computing introduce new means for efficient and flexible utilization of their infrastructures through a software-centric service paradigm \cite{Sonkoly2014UNIFYingView}. However, to realize this paradigm, there is a need to model the end-to-end service and have the ability to abstract and automate the control of physical and virtual resources delivering the service. The coordinated set of activities behind such process is commonly referred to as \textit{orchestration}. In general, orchestration refers to the idea of automatically selecting and controlling multiple resources, services, and systems to meet certain objectives (e.g., a customer requesting a specific network service). Altogether, the process shall be timely, consistent, secure, and lead to cost reduction due to automation and virtualization. We refer to \gls{nso} as the automated management and control processes involved in end-to-end services deployment and operations  performed mainly by telecommunication operators and service providers, involving different types of resources and potentially multiple operators, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{intro}. 

Dealing with the holistic nature of network services, \gls{nso} is responsible for decoupling the high-level service layer (e.g., applications, service  slices, \gls{oss}) from the underlying management and resources layers (e.g., controllers, \gls{ems}, \gls{vim}), providing agility, enabling innovative service, optimizing resources, and altogether delivering a more flexible infrastructure for tailored services delivery. By introducing service abstractions through well-defined data models, descriptors, and programming interfaces, \gls{nso} defines the interaction with (chains of) network functions in underlying technologies and infrastructures through a unifying pane glass for service definition, deployment, and operation. For example, NSO may connect traditional OSS/BSS to network functions running in virtualized infrastructures. This unifying tenet is illustrated through  the hourglass shape in Figure~\ref{orch}, where the  significance of NSO is highlighted as an inter-working technology-agnostic glue --- drawing an analogy to IP in the traditional network protocol stack. 

As today, broad understanding and practical definitions of \gls{nso} are still missing --- not only across but also inside networking communities. The maturity of ongoing efforts varies largely with the overall technical approach being very much fragmented and showing little consolidation around an overarching notion of network service orchestration. 

The main objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research, standardization, and software development efforts around the overcharged term of  \acrlong{nso}. We present an in-depth and up-to-date study on network service orchestration covering some historical background and context, enabling technologies, standardization activities, actual solutions, open challenges, and research opportunities. We propose a taxonomy of the main characteristics and features of NSO approaches. We also make the mapping of the \gls{nso} primary characteristics and technical implementations to current open source platforms and research projects.    

Throughout the survey, we distinguish between two types of domains. First, \textit{administrative domains}, which map to different organizations and therefore may exist within a single service provider or cover a set of service providers. In one administrative domain, multiple \textit{technology domains} can exist based on the type of technology in scope, for example, Cloud, \gls{sdn}, \gls{nfv}, or Legacy. 
Broadly speaking, we refer to \gls{nso} as the automated coordination of resources and services embracing both single-domain and multi-domain footprints.

    \label{mdo}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{mdo} presents a generic high-level reference model for multi-domain Network Service Orchestration, featuring a \gls{mdo} per administrative realm and including the notion of a Marketplace for business interactions. 
\glspl{mdo} coordinate resources and services in a multiple administrative domain scope covering multiple technology domains~\cite{5GPPPArchitectureWorkingGroup2016ViewArchitecture}. 
The exchange of information, resources, and services themselves are essential components of an end-to-end network service delivery.  The \gls{mdo} exposes the available services to the marketplace allowing service providers to sell network services directly to their customers or other providers under various possible resources consumption models (e.g., trading resources from each other). 
The \gls{mdo} can be seen as a single element with a possible split into two functional components: \gls{so} and \gls{ro}. The \gls{so} orchestrates high-level services while the \gls{ro} is responsible for managing resource and orchestrating workflows across technology domains. 
The \glspl{do} perform orchestration in each local domain acting on the underlying infrastructures and exposing resources and network functions northbound to the \gls{mdo}. 

\noindent \textbf{Related work.} Several works have somehow addressed the theme of orchestration in different scopes, including clouding computing \cite{Weerasiri2017}, \gls{sdn}~\cite{Jarraya2014},~\cite{surveySDN}, and \gls{nfv}~\cite{YongLi2015Software-DefinedSurvey},~\cite{Mijumbi2016NetworkChallenges},~\cite{Bhamare2016}. In~\cite{Weerasiri2017}, for example, the authors propose a taxonomy and survey of cloud orchestration techniques. However, its scope is limited to cloud resources. Saadon et al.~\cite{SAADON201917} presented an overview of orchestration standardization efforts and implementation in next-generation network management. However, while our approach has reviewed the broad NSO scope in Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs), Saadon et al. only specified the interactions of the orchestration layer and the OSS application layer. Vaquero et al.~\cite{VAQUERO201920} introduced next-generation orchestration techniques with a focus on the leading challenges  involved in diverse end-to-end orchestration processes. Differently, our survey  embraces the solution space by dissecting multi-faceted orchestration aspects and approaches from different communities.  

The work of Rotsos~et~al.~\cite{Rotsos2017NetworkSurvey} is arguably the first notable attempt to survey the realm of network service orchestration. The authors provide an analysis of diverse standardization activities around \gls{nso} from an operator perspective. The article follows a top-down approach, defining terminologies, requirements, and objectives of a network service orchestrator. 
In contrast, our definition and approach to \gls{nso} are distinct. We follow a systems-oriented and broadly generic approach,  where \gls{nso} encompasses high-level services as defined by telecommunications operators along business and technological operations for network service instantiation and run-time operation. Besides, we condense standardization efforts, challenges, solutions, and research projects of NSO landscape into single work. Most significantly, we feature 150+ references providing a broader scope covering:
\begin{itemize}
\item Historical overview of the very much overloaded orchestration term;
\item Comprehensive approach to NSO by clarifying fundamental aspects of core NSO functions, and how different research and standardization are addressing the topic;
\item Taxonomy of the main aspects of any NSO solution;
\item Up-to-date review of related standards activities;
\item Overview of relevant research projects and software frameworks.
\end{itemize}
