## Network Service Orchestration: A Survey

Business models of network service providers are
undergoing an evolving transformation fueled by vertical customer
demands and technological advances such as 5G, Software
Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Function Virtualization
(NFV). Emerging scenarios call for agile network
services consuming network, storage, and compute resources
across heterogeneous infrastructures and administrative domains.
Coordinating resource control and service creation across interconnected
domains and diverse technologies becomes a grand
challenge. Research and development efforts are being devoted
on enabling orchestration processes to automate, coordinate, and
manage the deployment and operation of network services. In this
survey, we delve into the topic of Network Service Orchestration
(NSO) by reviewing the historical background, relevant research
projects, enabling technologies, and standardization activities. We
define key concepts and propose a taxonomy of NSO approaches
and solutions to pave the way to the understanding of the
diverse ongoing efforts towards the realization of multiple NSO
application scenarios. Based on the analysis of the state of
affairs, we finalize by discussing a series of open challenges
and research opportunities, altogether contributing to a timely
and comprehensive survey on the vibrant and strategic topic of
network service orchestration.

Figure below presents a generic high-level reference model
for multi-domain Network Service Orchestration, featuring a
Multi-Domain Orchestrator (MDO) per administrative realm
and including the notion of a Marketplace for business interactions.

In this survey, our main objectives are to provide a comprehensive
review of research, standardization and software
development efforts around the overcharged term of Network
Service Orchestration. We present an in-depth and up-to-date
study on network service orchestration covering some history
and context, related enabling technologies, standardization activities,
actual solutions, open challenges and research opportunities.
